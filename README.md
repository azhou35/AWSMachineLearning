# AWSMachineLearning

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS is a cloud computing platform where businesses access technologies to easily solve their technical problems. AWS hosts over 100 services (inaccurate), ranging from servers, storage, mobile development, and security. AWS provides a large set of machine learning services that can be used even by those without prior experience. 

## Overview

Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use AWS Machine Learning Services to solve business problems in natural language processing. Through the next series of modules, these modules will introduce the basics of machine learning (ML) so you can become ML literate. Users will follow step-by-step tutorials about how to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) services to solve real-world problems. 


## Background 

These notebooks are intended for individuals working in technical roles who want to use AWS Services for their business. Prior background in Python and Jupyter Notebooks is assumed. No mathematical or statistical background is required. 

The notebooks can be opened through [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service for machine learning workflows. 

## Before You Begin 

In order to run the modules in the curriculum, you will need to set up your AWS account. An AWS Account is how you create and manage your AWS Resources. For more information on how to create an AWS Account, see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/). 

For each module, you will need to set up an IAM role. An IAM role is a role you create in your AWS account that has specific permissions. Learn more about how to set up IAM roles [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security-iam.html).

## How to Open Curriculum 

After you have all the accounts set up, you can open the Jupyter notebooks that contain the curriculum. You will open them in Amazon SageMaker. Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance is an instance that launches the Jupyter Notebook App in the browser. Learn more about Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.html).

1. Log into AWS account. 
2. Go to the Amazon SageMaker Console.
3. Find Notebook on the left navigation bar. Click Git repositories. 
4. Click to add a GitHub/Other Git-based repo. 
5. Input a unique SageMaker repository name and paste this GitHub Repostiory's URL.
