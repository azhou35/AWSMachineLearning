# AWSMachineLearning

## Overview

Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use AWS Machine Learning Services to solve business problems in natural language processing. Through the next series of modules, these modules will introduce the basics of machine learning (ML) so you can become ML literate. Users will follow step-by-step tutorials about how to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) services to solve real-world problems. 


## Background 

These notebooks are intended for individuals working in technical roles who want to use AWS Services for their business. Prior background in Python and Jupyter Notebooks is assumed. No mathematical or statistical background is required. 

The notebooks can be opened through [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/). Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service for machine learning workflows.

In order to run the modules in the curriculum, you will need:
* An [AWS Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html)
* [IAM User and Role Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security-iam.html)
* An [Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.html)
* An [S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-setup-working-env.html) 
 

## Usage 

To run these notebooks, go to the Amazon SageMaker Console. Then, under Notebook on the left, click Git repositories. From there, click to add a GitHub/Other Git-based repo. Input a unique SageMaker repository name and paste this GitHub Repostiory's URL.
